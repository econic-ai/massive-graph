## Core Requirements

### 1. Pattern-Based Encoding

The heart of the schema system is pattern-based property encoding, where frequently used patterns like `users[*].name` are assigned short PropertyIds that compress to just 1 byte for the most common 128 patterns. This approach leverages Shannon's information theory - the most frequent patterns get the shortest encodings, whilst less common patterns gracefully degrade to 2 bytes (for patterns 128-32K) or 3 bytes for rarely used patterns.

Each pattern includes variable-length parameter encoding for array indices and map keys, ensuring that the wire format remains compact even with dynamic data. The frequency-based allocation means that as usage patterns evolve, the schema can adapt to maintain near-optimal compression ratios.

### 2. Pattern Evolution and Discovery

The schema system is designed to evolve from concrete paths to generalised patterns as commonalities emerge. When a system starts with specific paths like `object.user1.name` and `object.user2.name`, the potential for a pattern like `object.{userId}.name` becomes apparent. Both the specific and generalised versions can coexist, with first-match resolution determining which encoding is used.

High-frequency specific paths, such as `object.admin.name`, retain their dedicated encodings even when general patterns exist, ensuring that the most common operations remain optimally compressed. Whilst automatic pattern detection is planned for future versions, the current system relies on explicit pattern registration, giving document owners full control over their compression dictionary.

### 3. Schema Management

Schema management centres on the principle of document owner authority - the owner of a document determines and publishes the schema, eliminating any convergence problems across distributed nodes. Each schema version is immutable and stored in wire-ready format, similar to how deltas are stored, ensuring that historical data can always be decoded.

To avoid per-document overhead, schemas are global resources that can be shared across entire document trees. Different document types use different schema families, with multiple versions active simultaneously to support gradual migration and backward compatibility. Documents reference these shared schemas rather than owning them, allowing thousands of documents to benefit from a single optimised compression dictionary.

### 4. Schema Evolution and Versioning

The schema system uses a two-byte major.minor versioning scheme included with each delta, providing clear compatibility guarantees. Within a major version, schemas maintain backward compatibility through an append-only property registry that never reuses PropertyIds. New properties can be added at the end of the schema (incrementing the minor version), and deleted properties are simply marked as inactive rather than removed, preventing any confusion from ID reuse.

Major version changes indicate breaking modifications such as property reordering for optimisation, which typically occurs only when documents exceed 32K properties or during scheduled maintenance windows. These major version increments are rare but necessary for long-term efficiency, requiring clients to update their schema before processing new deltas.

### 5. Subscription and Distribution

Schema distribution follows a bootstrap model where clients must have the schema before they can read or write documents. During the initial subscription handshake, the complete schema is transmitted, establishing the shared compression dictionary between client and server. After this initial sync, clients can fetch new schema versions on-demand when they encounter deltas with unknown versions.

This pre-shared dictionary approach ensures both parties use identical encoding and decoding rules, eliminating ambiguity in data interpretation. The schema effectively becomes a compression codec that both sides of the connection understand, similar to how video codecs work with shared dictionaries of motion patterns.

### 6. Optimisation Constraints

The schema system deliberately chooses practical optimisations over theoretical perfection. By maintaining byte-aligned encoding rather than bit-level packing, the system ensures efficient CPU operations without the overhead of bit manipulation. The goal is to achieve 80% of Shannon's theoretical optimal compression, which provides excellent compression ratios whilst keeping the implementation simple and fast.

Re-optimisation is intentionally rare, triggered only when crossing significant thresholds like the 32K property boundary or during scheduled maintenance periods. Common patterns like `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` maintain consistent encodings across schema versions, providing stability for the most frequently accessed properties and enabling client-side optimisations like pattern caching.

### 7. Backwards Compatibility Strategy

The backwards compatibility strategy allows operations to continue even with schema version mismatches, though with important caveats. Deltas can be processed with outdated schemas as long as they share the same major version - the system gracefully handles missing properties or inactive fields. When a client with an older minor version receives a delta with a new property, it can still process other fields normally.

Each delta includes its schema version, allowing receivers to detect mismatches and request updates without blocking operations. However, major version differences are incompatible by design, as they may involve structural changes like property reordering that would cause incorrect data interpretation. In these cases, the schema must be updated before processing can continue, ensuring data integrity over operational convenience.

## Core Data Structures

### Schema Version
Represents schema versioning with major.minor semantics for compatibility management.

```rust
/// Schema version with major.minor semantics
/// Packed into u16 for efficient atomic operations and wire format
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct SchemaVersion {
    major: u8,  // Breaking changes (reordering, restructuring)
    minor: u8,  // Compatible changes (additions, tombstones)
}

impl SchemaVersion {
    /// Pack into u16 for atomic operations
    pub fn to_u16(&self) -> u16 {
        ((self.major as u16) << 8) | (self.minor as u16)
    }
    
    /// Unpack from u16
    pub fn from_u16(val: u16) -> Self {
        SchemaVersion {
            major: (val >> 8) as u8,
            minor: (val & 0xFF) as u8,
        }
    }
}
```

### Property and Schema Identifiers
Type-safe identifiers for schemas and properties, designed for efficient wire format.

```rust
/// Unique identifier for schema families
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct SchemaFamilyId(u32);

/// Property identifier with variable-length encoding
/// 0-127: single byte, 128-32K: two bytes, 32K+: three bytes
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct PropertyId(pub u16);
```

### Schema Structure
Immutable schema containing the pattern compression dictionary. Once created, a schema version never changes, ensuring historical deltas remain valid.

```rust
/// Main schema structure - immutable once created
pub struct Schema {
    /// Unique identifier for this schema family
    family_id: SchemaFamilyId,
    
    /// Version of this schema
    version: SchemaVersion,
    
    /// When this schema was created (unix timestamp)
    created_at: u64,
    
    /// Pattern registry - the compression dictionary
    /// Index in vec IS the PropertyId value
    patterns: Vec<PatternEntry>,
    
    /// Wire-ready serialized form for transmission
    /// Pre-computed for efficient distribution
    wire_bytes: Bytes,
    
    /// Parent schema for inheritance (Global -> DocumentType -> Instance)
    parent: Option<(SchemaFamilyId, SchemaVersion)>,
}
```

### Pattern Entry
Individual pattern in the schema's compression dictionary. Patterns are templates with parameters that can represent many concrete property paths.

```rust
/// Individual pattern in the schema
pub struct PatternEntry {
    /// Pattern template like "users[*].classDict.{}.assessments[*].score"
    pattern: String,
    
    /// Parameter types needed to hydrate this pattern
    param_types: Vec<ParamType>,
    
    /// Frequency count for optimization decisions
    frequency: u64,
    
    /// Whether this pattern is active (false = tombstoned)
    active: bool,
}

/// Types of parameters in patterns
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
#[repr(u8)]  // Explicit discriminant for wire format
pub enum ParamType {
    ArrayIndex = 0x01,      // [*] -> varint encoded index
    MapKey = 0x02,          // {} -> length-prefixed string
    DynamicSegment = 0x03,  // {{userId}} -> captured string segment
}
```

### Schema Registry
Global registry managing all schemas with sharding for reduced contention. The registry is the source of truth for all schema versions.

```rust
/// Manages all schemas in the system
pub struct SchemaRegistry {
    /// Sharded by family for less contention (16 shards)
    /// Hash family_id to determine shard
    schemas: [DashMap<(SchemaFamilyId, SchemaVersion), Arc<Schema>>; 16],
    
    /// Version cache for fast lookups without loading full schema
    version_cache: DashMap<SchemaFamilyId, AtomicU16>,
    
    /// Global patterns shared across families
    global_patterns: Arc<Schema>,
}

impl SchemaRegistry {
    /// Get schema with sharding for reduced contention
    pub fn get_schema(&self, family: SchemaFamilyId, version: SchemaVersion) -> Option<Arc<Schema>> {
        let shard = (family.0 as usize) % 16;
        self.schemas[shard].get(&(family, version)).map(|s| s.clone())
    }
}
```

### Schema Family
Collection of related schemas with version history. Each document type typically has its own family.

```rust
/// A family of related schemas with version history
pub struct SchemaFamily {
    /// Unique identifier
    id: SchemaFamilyId,
    
    /// Human-readable name
    name: String,
    
    /// All versions of this schema (using DashMap for thread-safety)
    versions: DashMap<SchemaVersion, Arc<Schema>>,
    
    /// Current active version for new deltas (atomically updatable)
    current: AtomicU16,  // Packed SchemaVersion
}
```

## Document Integration

### Optimized Document Structure
Document structure optimized for cache efficiency with frequently accessed patterns cached to avoid schema pointer dereference.

```rust
/// Document with optimized schema access
pub struct Document {
    /// Cache-line aligned hot path data
    #[repr(align(64))]
    pub struct HotCache {
        /// Reference to shared schema (atomic for lock-free updates)
        schema_ptr: AtomicPtr<Schema>,
        
        /// Packed schema version for fast equality checks
        schema_version: AtomicU16,
        
        /// Most frequent patterns cached (avoid schema dereference)
        /// Covers ~90% of operations
        cached_patterns: [Option<PatternEntry>; 8],
        
        /// Cached PropertyIds for fastest lookup
        cached_ids: [PropertyId; 8],
    }
    
    hot: HotCache,
    
    // ... other document fields
}
```

The cache-line alignment ensures all hot path data fits in a single CPU cache line (64 bytes), minimizing memory access latency. The cached patterns eliminate schema pointer dereference for the most common operations.

### Thread-Safe Schema Updates
Lock-free schema reference updates ensure readers never block during schema evolution.

```rust
impl Document {
    /// Process delta with potential schema upgrade
    pub fn process_delta(&self, delta: DeltaWithSchema) {
        // Fast path 1: Check cached patterns (no schema access!)
        if delta.property_id.0 < 8 {
            if let Some(pattern) = &self.hot.cached_patterns[delta.property_id.0 as usize] {
                return self.apply_with_cached_pattern(delta, pattern);
            }
        }
        
        // Fast path 2: Version matches
        let current_version = self.hot.schema_version.load(Ordering::Acquire);
        if current_version == delta.schema_version.to_u16() {
            let schema = unsafe { &*self.hot.schema_ptr.load(Ordering::Acquire) };
            return self.apply_delta(delta, schema);
        }
        
        // Check compatibility
        let current = SchemaVersion::from_u16(current_version);
        if current.major == delta.schema_version.major {
            // Minor version difference - still compatible
            let schema = unsafe { &*self.hot.schema_ptr.load(Ordering::Acquire) };
            return self.apply_delta(delta, schema);
        }
        
        // Major version change - need upgrade
        self.update_schema_reference(delta.schema_version);
    }
    
    /// Update reference to new schema version
    fn update_schema_reference(&self, new_version: SchemaVersion) {
        let registry = get_schema_registry();
        
        if let Some(schema_arc) = registry.get_schema(self.family_id, new_version) {
            // Update atomic pointer to shared schema
            let new_ptr = Arc::as_ptr(&schema_arc) as *mut Schema;
            self.hot.schema_ptr.store(new_ptr, Ordering::Release);
            
            // Update version for fast checks
            self.hot.schema_version.store(new_version.to_u16(), Ordering::Release);
            
            // Update cached patterns
            self.refresh_pattern_cache(&schema_arc);
        }
    }
}
```

## Wire Format Structures

### Delta with Schema
Wire format for deltas including schema version and self-describing parameters.

```rust
/// Delta with embedded schema version
pub struct DeltaWithSchema {
    /// Schema version used for encoding (2 bytes on wire)
    schema_version: SchemaVersion,
    
    /// Encoded property (1-3 bytes based on PropertyId)
    property_id: PropertyId,
    
    /// Self-describing parameters to hydrate the pattern
    params: Vec<EncodedParam>,
    
    /// Operation type
    operation: DeltaOp,
    
    /// Operation value
    value: Bytes,
}

/// Self-describing parameter encoding
pub struct EncodedParam {
    /// Parameter type (1 byte on wire)
    param_type: ParamType,
    
    /// Variable-length encoded data
    /// - ArrayIndex: varint (self-terminating)
    /// - MapKey: length-prefixed string
    /// - DynamicSegment: length-prefixed string
    data: Bytes,
}
```

### Wire Encoding Examples
The wire format is designed for minimal overhead while remaining self-describing:

```rust
// Pattern: "users[*].profile.{}.theme"
// Concrete path: users[42].profile.darkMode.theme = true

// Wire encoding:
[0x00,0x01]              // Schema version 0.1 (2 bytes)
[0x0A]                   // PropertyId 10 (1 byte, < 128)
[0x01][0x2A]            // Param 1: ArrayIndex type + varint(42)
[0x02][0x08]["darkMode"] // Param 2: MapKey type + length + string
[0x01]                   // Operation: Set
[0x01]                   // Value: boolean true
// Total: 16 bytes vs ~35 bytes for string path
```
