# Massive Graph.

Massive Graph is a high-throughput real-time document database specifically designed to handle graph data structures in collaborative environments. As an open-source project, it's built to support a future where data control and collaborative intelligence are streamlined.

At its core, Massive Graph enables real-time massive graph synchronisation for multi-player multi-agent economic games and collaborative intelligence systems. It maintains consistency across complex, interconnected state changes in distributed environments, providing the foundation for next-generation intelligent markets and human-AI information coordination.

- **True Data Control**: Your data remains yours, with cryptographic proof of lineage
- **Zero-Trust Collaboration**: Share and collaborate without surrendering control of your information
- **Real-Time Synchronisation**: Changes propagate instantly to all authorised participants
- **Scalable to Millions**: Designed from the ground up to handle massive-scale collaboration
- **End-to-End Security**: Cryptographic integrity from creation to consumption

## Open Source Commitment

Massive Graph is developed as an open-source project to ensure:

1. **Transparency**: Every aspect of the system can be inspected and verified
2. **Community Innovation**: Contributions from developers worldwide can accelerate progress
3. **Trust**: No hidden mechanisms or backdoors can exist in the codebase
4. **Longevity**: The technology will continue to evolve regardless of any single entity

Our open-source approach aligns with our mission to create a collaboration infrastructure that respects data control and integrity by design.
