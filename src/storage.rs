//! Storage layer for Massive Graph Database
//! 
//! This module provides the storage abstraction layer that enables different
//! storage backends while maintaining consistent APIs for document operations.
//! 
//! The architecture follows the principle of user isolation, where each user
//! has their own document space to ensure security and eliminate concurrency
//! bottlenecks between different users.
//!
//! ðŸš¨ ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE: All changes to this module must follow principles
//! defined in ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md. Key requirements:
//! - User isolation first (no cross-user locks)
//! - Vec<u8> interface for storage flexibility
//! - Lock-free patterns preferred over Mutex
